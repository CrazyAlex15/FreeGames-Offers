## 🚀 Why add this bot?

🎮 **Daily Free Games**
The bot scans the web every 6 hours to find paid games that are currently 100% free. It supports major platforms like **Steam**, **Epic Games Store**, **GOG**, **Ubisoft Connect**, and **Battle.net**.

🔔 **Smart Notifications**
* **Zero Spam:** It never posts the same offer twice.
* **Role Pings:** Optionally alert a specific role (e.g., `@Gamers`) so your members grab the game before the offer expires.
* **Clean Look:** Posts beautiful, easy-to-read cards with the game title, original price, and direct download link.

🌍 **Universal & Easy**
Works on any server! As an Admin, you decide exactly which channel the bot uses.
